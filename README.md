# Causal-emergence-analysis
This repository contains the codes for our paper, entitled "Dual-Valued Functions of Dual Matrices with Applications in Causal Emergence". Specifically, the dual-valued matrix Ky Fan p-k-norm is employed for causal emergence to reveal the underlying patterns and structural dependencies within complex systems.

## Codes
* [dualsvd.m](dualsvd.m) is the code for the optimal rank-k approximation of dual matrices under the quasi-metric d<sub>*</sub>. For more details, please refer to [1].
* [DKFnorm.m](DKFnorm.m) is the code for calculating the dual-valued Ky Fan p-k-norm of a dual matrix.
* [Markov.m](Markov.m) is the code for our numerical experiments on a dumbbell Markov chain. Our findings indicate that the value of k, corresponding to the maximum value of the infinitesimal part of the dual-valued Ky Fan p-k-norm by adjusting p in the interval [1, 2), characterizes the optimal classification number of the system for the occurrence of the causal emergence.
